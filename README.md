# Credit-Risk-Segmentation
📖 Overview
This project provides a comprehensive visual analysis of credit card customers' financial behaviors, focusing on risk segmentation and utilization trends. It helps financial institutions identify risk patterns and optimize decision-making for credit approvals, customer targeting, and credit limit adjustments.

🎯 Objectives
Segment credit card customers based on financial risk (High, Moderate, Low).

Analyze key financial behaviors: payments, credit balance, and utilization ratios.

Identify patterns and relationships between tenure, risk level, and payment behavior.

Explore how credit utilization and risk are distributed across the customer base.

🛠️ Tools Used
Tableau for interactive dashboard development

Excel/CSV dataset (source assumed or mention Kaggle if applicable)

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing in Tableau or Excel

📊 Dashboards Overview
Dashboard 1: Credit Risk Segmentation

KPI Metrics: Total Customers, Avg. Balance, Avg. Tenure

Dashboard 2: Utilization Patterns

Utilization Ratio Distribution

Risk-wise Avg Payment Ratio & Utility Ratio

Credit vs. Balance comparison

Utilization Ratio trends over Tenure

KPI Metric: Avg. Utilization Ratio

❓ Key Questions Answered
How are customers distributed across risk levels?

What’s the relationship between risk and credit utilization?

Do higher tenure customers make more purchases?

How do payments compare to minimum required payments?

Are balances aligned with credit limits across risk levels?

Which utilization ranges are most common?

📈 Insights & Takeaways
Majority of customers fall into the Low Risk category.

High-risk customers show significantly higher utilization ratios.

Payment behavior closely aligns with risk level: high-risk customers tend to have lower payment-to-balance ratios.

Customers with longer tenure tend to spend more and maintain healthier utilization patterns.

💡 Future Improvements
Add predictive modeling for credit default or delinquency.

Introduce demographic segmentation (Age, Gender, Income if available).

Create a scorecard metric for customer creditworthiness.
